1. Purpose

The purpose of the Surrey Air Cadets Slack team is for all members of the Squadron to be able to meet and communicate online.


2. Expected Behavior

This is simple:

a. Be respectful.

b. Speak as though you were talking directly to someone's face.

c. Assume everyone can or will eventually see everything you type.


3. Unacceptable Behavior

If you aren't allowed to do it at Cadets, you're not allowed to do it here.


4. Reporting Guidelines

If you have an issue, it's important you are heard.

Follow the chain of command.

If that does not result in an outcome you are happy with, move up the chain of command - respectfully.
